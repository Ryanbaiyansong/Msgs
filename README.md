# Msgs
Msgs is a website that effectively and safely facilitates the communication between attendees for various events, such as college career fairs, professional networking events, academic conferences, etc. By creating an event-specific personal QR code linked to Msgs users' personal emails or facebook, our users are able to initiate conversations, send and receive messages with other attendees for this specific event. Moreover, they can freely enable or disable the linkage between the event-specific personal QR code and their contact methods.
